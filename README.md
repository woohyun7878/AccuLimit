# Charge Limiter

macOS app to set battery charge limit for Intel MacBooks

## Description

This app modifies a parameter called `BCLM` (presumably "Battery Charge Level Max") in the SMC which limits the charge of the battery to a set value. It also modifies a parameter called `BFCL` ("Battery Final Charge Level") which controls the MagSafe LED indicator light to display the correct status.

The source code can be viewed by opening `src/Charge Limiter.app` in Apple's Script Editor. It is written in Javascript Application Scripting (or JXA).

The companion `smcutil` binary (located under `src/Charge Limiter.app/Contents/Resources`) was copied from [this repository](https://github.com/sicreative/BatteryStatusShow/blob/master/BatteryStatusShow/smcutil/Products/usr/local/bin/smcutil). The source code for `smcutil` is also available there.

## Releases

Download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/godly-devotion/charge-limiter/releases) page.

## Running

The app is not code signed so you need to right-click on the app and select "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper's warning.

If you wish to undo the changes, set the charge limit to "100". The app itself does not install anything so if you do not need it anymore you can safely move it to the trash.

## Updates

This app will automatically check and notify you for any updates when you run it.
